This issue arises due to conflicts between the installed version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code> and the version required by TensorFlow. Fortunately, you can resolve this problem with a couple of simple commands.</p> <h3 id="why-the-error-occurs">Why the Error Occurs</h3> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code> package is a Python library that TensorFlow depends on for functionality, especially in relation to decorators and function wrapping. When TensorFlow is installed or upgraded, it requires a specific version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code>. If an incompatible version is already installed, TensorFlow will attempt to uninstall it but may run into permissions issues or other conflicts.</p> <h3 id="steps-to-resolve-the-issue">Steps to Resolve the Issue</h3> <p>To successfully install TensorFlow while resolving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code> conflict, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Upgrade wrapt with Ignore Installed Flag:</strong> Open your terminal and run the following command. This will force the installation of the latest version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code>, ignoring any currently installed versions.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install </span>wrapt <span class="nt">--upgrade</span> <span class="nt">--ignore-installed</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> <p>This command tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code> to upgrade <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code> and bypass any checks that might prevent it from being updated. By doing this, you ensure that you have the version that is compatible with TensorFlow.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Install TensorFlow:</strong> After successfully upgrading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code>, you can now proceed to install TensorFlow:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install </span>tensorflow
</code></pre></div> </div> <p>This command will install TensorFlow along with its dependencies, including the correctly versioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapt</code> package.</p> </li> </ol> </body></html>
