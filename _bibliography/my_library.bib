	abstract = {The safety of workers and equipment in the power system can be done using a safety system. This system consists of several components that work based on certain algorithms that will work if the system experiences interference. One major disturbance that can harm the system and the workers in it is the arc of fire. This disturbance begins with a short circuit that has enough energy to produce arcs of fire and even to an explosion. Relay equipment and circuit breakers can be used to protect the system. While humans can use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as a safety. PPE is determined based on the energy level of the incident from the arc. One effort to reduce this energy is to reduce the time of occurrence of arcs. The time of the incident is very closely related to relay work time. Relay working time determines the circuit breaker (CB) termination when a short circuit occurs. The shorter the relay's working time, the arc will also be shorter. Improvising the relay work time must pay attention to coordination between relays so that no trip errors occur. For this reason, the Zone Selective Interlocking (ZSI) method will be used to maximize work time and relay coordination by dividing the system into several protection zones. This study takes the case of a 20 kV distribution system. A distribution system with a large amount of load will increase the potential for interference. Simulation results show that ZSI can reduce the time the arc arises and does not interfere with relay coordination.},

	abstract = {In this paper artificial dielectric material is used to make microstrip antennas with a resonance frequency of 2.4 GHz. Artificial dielectric materials are produced by the modification of natural dielectrics present in conventional antennas. Modifications were made in 3 ways and antenna parameter changes were observed. The first modification is to vary the thickness of the substrate from 1.6 mm to 11.2 mm. At a thickness of 6.4 m, the results are obtained quite well so that it can be used as a reference for further simulation. The second modification is by inserting a cylindrical conductor on the substrate, with a variation of the cylinder conductor being inserted from 4 to 12. The results obtained are 4 conductors that produce the best parameters of the antenna, including resonant frequency, amplification, VSWR, radiation pattern and S11. The last modification is to vary the diameter of the inserted conductor from 1 mm to 1.5 mm. As with previous simulations, any change in the conductor diameter is observed for the parameters of the antenna. Results from the 1.2 mm diameter conductor are 2.4 GHz resonance frequency, 7.67 dB gain, -46.13 dB S11, 1.03 VSWR and 125 MHz bandwidth. The results of this study show that all material changes made affect all parameters of the antenna, such as decreasing frequency, larger or smaller bandwidth, changes in the direction of the pattern of radiation, VSWR values, and also S11.},

Fenomena ini dikenal dengan the cocktail party effect. Dalam sebuah studi awal dijelaskan bahwa binaural hearing memberikan kontribusi penting dalam efek tersebut. Penelitian tentang pemisahan suara yang berdasarkan pada lokalisasi bunyi telah dilakukan sebelumnya. Pada penelitian tersebut, pemisahan suara tercampur hanya berdasarkan binaural cue - interaural time difference. Maka pada penelitian ini, akan dilakukan pemisahan suara dari input binaural dengan 2 sensor mikrofon dari dua sumber suara berdasarkan kedua binaural cue tersebut yaitu interaural time difference (ITD) dan interaural level difference (ILD) menggunakan binary mask. Untuk mengestimasi nilai ITD, digunakan metode cross-correlation yang nilai ITD direpresentasikan sebagai nilai time delay pada pergeseran peak pada unit time-frequency. Binary mask diestimasi berdasarkan pola perubahan nilai interaural time difference dan interaural level difference terhadap nilai relative strength dari sinyal target yang dihitung secara statistik menggunakan probability density estimation. Hasil pemisahan sumber suara tercampur menunjukkan performa yang baik dengan SNR sebesar 3 dB.},

upcoming solution to simplify sea water environment was to conduct the

experiment performed in the water tank, the comparison of source
separation using linear mixture and in-tank mixture will be analyzed.
The source separation was performed in three different methods, Time
Domain Independent Component Analysis (TDICA), Frequency Domain
Independent Component Analysis (FDICA), and Multi Stage Independent
Component Analysis (MSICA). The experiment result showing that compared
to the linear mixture source, the performance of source separation
degrade significantly while performed on the water tank, indicated by
the MSE value which increased from 310-8 to
610-2. This result showing that the source
mixture that occurred in water tank, much more complex compared to the

	abstract = {Pump damage detection methods (based on vibration) are normally used on a pump located on a single foundation. However, when more than one pump located on a single foundation, the vibration transmissibility at one pump with other pump vibrations will affect each other. In this case, we can not use pump damage detection methods normally. Hence, this research used accelerometer array to know the effect of vibration transmissibility to the result of pump damage detection method. Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis we known that the effect of vibration transmissibility on the diagnosis of detection of pump damage is destructive superposition occurs in the configuration of misalignment \& unbalance pump (-7.7296 dB) and misalignment \& bearing fault pump (-8.037 dB). While the constructive superposition occurs in the configuration of unbalance \& bearing fault pump (3.6719 dB). The conclusion is transmissibility ratio from accelerometer array measurement could be used to determine the superposition of vibration between two different pump which mounted on same supporting base.},

This phenomenon is known as the cocktail party effect. In an early study, has been explained that binaural hearing have an important contribution to the cocktail party effect. So in this study, will be performed separation on the input binaural sound with 2 microphone sensors of two sound sources based on both the binaural cue, interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) using binary mask. To estimate value of ITD, is used cross-correlation method which the value of ITD represented as time delay of peak shifting at time-frequency unit. Binary mask is estimated based on pattern of ITD and ILD to relative strength of target that computed statistically using probability density estimation.

Smartphone as revolutionary device now is being used in all aspect of life including journalism; personally and professionally. Although many smartphones have two microphones (main and rear) the only main microphone is widely used for voice recording. This is why the NMF algorithm widely used for this purpose of speech enhancement. This paper evaluate speech enhancement on smartphone voice recording by using some algorithms mentioned previously. We also extend the NMF algorithm to Kulback-Leibler NMF with supervised separation. The last algorithm shows improved result compared to others by spectrogram and PESQ score evaluation.},
