Hi, my name is Mifta Nur Farid. I am a lecturer in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.itk.ac.id), [Institut Teknologi Kalimantan](https://itk.ac.id), Indonesia.

My research focuses on neural networks and their applications in speech signal processing.

I teach several courses, including numerical methods, digital signal processing, artificial intelligence, audio signal processing, and data communication.

~~Currently, I am seeking PhD opportunities in the field of speech signal processing.~~

I am now pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)](https://www.its.ac.id), Surabaya, Indonesia.

My current doctoral research focuses on **segmentation of carotid artery ultrasound images**, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis for cardiovascular disease assessment.

If you are interested in collaborating on research, please feel free to contact me.
