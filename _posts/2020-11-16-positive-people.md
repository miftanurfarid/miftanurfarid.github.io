**Why is it important to know these things?** Because people are drawn to those with a positive personality. Have you ever had a "toxic" friend? Annoying, right? So, strive to be a positive person. Additionally, individuals with a positive personality can greatly improve their mental health.

Here are some habits of naturally positive people:

1. Surrounding themselves with positive friends.
2. Appreciating even the smallest things.
3. Having an enjoyable morning routine. Don’t start your day with something you dislike.
4. Always seeking positive news.
5. Continuously striving and valuing their achievements. They realize they are not special, so they need to put in effort to get what they want.
6. Being solution-oriented.
7. Not complaining or blaming circumstances.
8. Always doing good without expecting anything in return.
9. Not judging themselves.
10. Feeling happy when others are happy. They don’t feel envy or jealousy.
11. Being able to say "no" instead of always saying "yes." They can decline things that might harm or disrupt their happiness without offending others.
12. Holding no grudges. Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and hoping the other person suffers.
