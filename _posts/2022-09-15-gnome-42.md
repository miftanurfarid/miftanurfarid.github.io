By default, applications installed on Linux with Gnome 42 are not sorted alphabetically; instead, they appear in the order they were installed, as shown in Figure 1 below.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gnome1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Figure 1. Unsorted Application List**

To sort these applications alphabetically, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell app-picker-layout "[]"
```

After running this command, restart or log out to see the change. The application list should now appear in alphabetical order, as shown in Figure 2.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gnome2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gnome3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/gnome4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Limitations**:  
This method requires a restart or logout to take effect. Additionally, each time a new application is installed, it won’t automatically be placed in alphabetical order. You’ll need to rerun the command above after each installation.
