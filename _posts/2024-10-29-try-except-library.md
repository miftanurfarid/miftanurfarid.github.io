To ensure that required libraries like `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `librosa` are installed, you can use a `try-except` block to check for imports and install them using `subprocess`. Here’s an example implementation:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

# List of required libraries
libraries = ['matplotlib', 'numpy', 'librosa', 'os']

for library in libraries:
    try:
        __import__(library)
        print(f"{library} is already installed.")
    except ImportError:
        print(f"{library} is not installed. Installing {library}...")
        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", library])
```

Note:
- The `os` library is part of Python's standard library, so it shouldn’t require installation. You can remove it from the list if it’s not needed.
- To run this, Python must have internet access and permission to install libraries.
