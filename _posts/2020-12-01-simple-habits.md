**Becoming smarter doesn't mean you have to spend a lot of time and energy every day. Just 5 to 10 minutes each day can already make you a smarter person.**

The habits that can help make us smarter are taken from medium.com, but I forgot to note the link. Hehe.

1. **Plan what you will learn for the upcoming week.** Avoid over-planning or under-acting; keep it realistic. Reflect on what you've already learned to avoid getting stuck in a comfort zone, and use this to decide what to study next.
2. **Read quality books.** The books you read will reflect who you are.
3. **Try to connect new things you've learned.** The more you learn, the more connections you can make, which can strengthen your understanding of the material. From what I know, Elon Musk uses this method.
4. **Read useful newsletters.** Don’t fill your days with negative news.
5. **Create useful and original work.** Then try sharing it with others. This is important because, during the creation process, you will experience failure. These failures are crucial, as you will learn a lot from them.
6. **Write down what you've learned.** It doesn’t have to be lengthy.
7. **Teach others.** It's undeniable that teaching others can enhance our understanding.
8. **Meditate.** Muslims may replace this with performing tahajjud prayers.
9. **Take time to think.** Based on what you've learned, reflect on whether you can create something better. Seek novelty.
10. **Improve your mental strength.**
11. **Engage in self-reflection.**
12. **Challenge yourself.** Set tougher targets than before.
