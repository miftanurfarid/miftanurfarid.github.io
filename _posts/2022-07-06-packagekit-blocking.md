If PackageKit is blocking Zypper, you can disable and mask the PackageKit service to prevent it from running:

1. **Disable and stop PackageKit:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable --now packagekit.service
   ```
   This command stops the service immediately and disables it from starting on boot.

2. **Mask the PackageKit service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl mask packagekit.service
   ```
   Masking the service prevents it from being started by any means, ensuring it wonâ€™t interfere with Zypper.

By disabling and masking PackageKit, you can freely use Zypper for package management without interruptions.
