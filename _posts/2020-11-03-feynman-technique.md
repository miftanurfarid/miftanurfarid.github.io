Have you ever experienced a moment when you can’t remember anything you’ve read? Or after finishing a book, when a friend asks, “What is that book about?” and you find yourself unable to explain its content?

“Yeah, that’s basically what the book is about.”

This is normal, as our brains work that way. When we experience “overstimulation,” our brains filter out and forget most of what we’ve done, including reading. (It seems that men often experience this 😁)

However, there’s a specific technique that can help us remember anything we’ve read.

### The Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique will assist us in remembering and understanding whatever we’ve learned.

This technique consists of four steps:

1. **Choose a book, finish it, and write down the title and concepts on a blank sheet of paper.**

   After completing the book you’ve chosen to understand, try writing down the title and the important concepts you remember. When writing these concepts, use language that is easy to comprehend.

2. **Explain it to a child.**

   Try to explain what you’ve understood to a child. You’ll need to use simple language that a child can grasp.

3. **Identify parts that you don’t understand well and re-read those sections.**

   While explaining the key points, there will likely be some areas that you didn’t understand fully. But don’t worry; this is a good thing, as it helps you pinpoint what you don’t understand. Then, read those sections again.

4. **Create a simpler explanation.**

   This is an optional step. After finishing the book and understanding it, you might feel that it could be simplified further. However, not all books can be simplified in this way.

So, that’s the technique for comprehending whatever we read. I hope you find it helpful.
