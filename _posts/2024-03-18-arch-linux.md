description: With KDE Plasma 6 released in February 2024 and no immediate plans for it on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I decided to return to Arch Linux for a fresh experience.

When Plasma 6 was released on February 28, 2024[^1], I was eager to try it out. Unfortunately, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed will not be releasing Plasma 6 anytime soon[^2]. After reading information on the Linux Indonesia Forum[^3] and discovering that Arch Linux had already included Plasma 6, I decided to use (again) Arch Linux. The last time I used this rolling release distro was in 2020, and I had assistance from a friend[^4] during the installation process.

I took advantage of the Nyepi holiday from March 11 to 12, 2024, to install Arch Linux. When I searched for Arch Linux installation tutorials, I was surprised by a video from DT explaining how easy the installation process has become[^5]. It is vastly different from my experience in 2020. Although I faced a minor issue related to needing an update for archinstall, the solutions provided in the forum were very helpful[^6]. As a result, I successfully completed the installation with ease. I hope there will be no issues for the remainder of this semester.
