If you need to rename or customize the title of a theorem, lemma, or similar environment in Beamer, you can use the `block` environment. This provides flexibility to name the block with any title you prefer, allowing you to maintain consistency with the style and formatting of your presentation.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of using a custom title in a Beamer slide:

```latex
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Frame Title}
    \begin{block}{Any Title}
        Simmons Hall is composed of metal and concrete.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
```

In this example:

- **Frame Title** is the title of the frame.
- **Any Title** is the customized title for the block, which can replace a standard "Theorem" or "Lemma" title.

This method keeps your content visually aligned with Beamerâ€™s design, while allowing custom naming for sections typically reserved for formal mathematical environments.
