In Beamer presentations, you can create interactive buttons that open a URL in a web browser using linking commands from the `hyperref` package. For example, the `\href` command can be used to link a button to any URL.

### Example

Here’s a simple example to create a button in Beamer that links to a website:

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
 
\begin{document}
 
\begin{frame}
    \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/20800/5701}{\beamergotobutton{Link}}
\end{frame}
 
\end{document}
```

In this example:

- `\href{URL}{\beamergotobutton{Button Text}}` is the command that creates the button. Replace `URL` with your desired link and `Button Text` with your button’s label.
- `\beamergotobutton` generates a clickable button styled in Beamer’s theme, making it visually distinct and easy to use in your presentation.

This technique is particularly useful for embedding links directly into your slides, making it easy to navigate to external resources during a presentation.
